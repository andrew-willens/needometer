      "synopsis": "Right now our table tennis club is predominantly a spectator sport. The 30+ students that routinely come to play are currently spending most of the 90 minutes waiting to play on a single table that we have constructed by pushing three smaller tables together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are table tennis novices but are already talking about playing in tournaments. They have no shortage of energy and dedication, despite a state and a district that has been failing them  financially. Because of budget cuts, this table tennis club is one of the only after school activities available at our school, and it is here solely due to student interest. They have taken to this club from the beginning of the semester when thirty of them showed up after school just to learn the rules. Their loyalty and their excitement is what makes me want to find new resources for them. They deserve to play ping pong and not just to watch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major benefit to having these two tables will be the ability to conduct tournaments in a reasonable amount of time. With our current set-up, a tournament involving all of our members takes between two and three hours. With these two tables we can easily complete a tournament in the 90 minutes we have available. Also, in addition to allowing more people to play, these tables will be regulation size, unlike the &#034;table&#034; we constructed out of three school desks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although nobody would say that the funding problem in our district is evidenced primarily by a lack of ping pong clubs, I think the lack of extracurricular activities in impoverished school districts is more of a problem than it first seems. These after school activities draw students to school and are significant times that students often remember more than individual classes. It&#039;s not that the core subjects don&#039;t matter, but our school hasn&#039;t lost its core subjects--it&#039;s lost its clubs",

      "synopsis": "The soccer program at our school is growing every season.  We have extremely committed student athletes in both the boys and girls programs.  The addition of these balls would help us continue to build our ball handling, shooting and passing abilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our high school is a selective enrollment math and science academy located in West Englewood, and my students commute from all over the South Side to come here. My students are 69.2% African American and 25.7% Hispanic, over 69% qualify for free or reduced lunch. They are hardworking and determined to reach their goals. They challenge themselves, and they like to be challenged in every way possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we move into the fall, the other soccer coaches and myself created a soccer class that is offered on our enrichment day.  Due to student demand we need additional soccer balls.  These materials would be used during the school day as well as for students who dedicate their after school time to soccer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will allow our learners to better build the skills that allow them to fully appreciate the great sport of soccer.  I am fortunate to teach and coach at a school where students go out of their way to support their peers.  Deepening their skill set will allow them to fully appreciate the importance of playing together on the field and how it impacts their teams performance.  Being able to generalize this skill will enhance their opportunities to work collaboratively in their lives.",

      "synopsis": "The classroom is a wonderful place to learn, but on warm spring days sometimes you just need to go outside for a change of scenery. Many students, and sometimes even the teacher, just need to MOVE! We can learn outside, on the floor, or even in the hallway! Learning no longer means desk work! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are an extremely enthusiastic group of fourth graders that share in my love of movement and fun! I encourage singing, dancing, making up cheers, and any else that makes learning easier! In our classroom we will do whatever it takes to learn the material and master important skills, and if that means ditching our desks and heading out on the move, then that is what we shall do! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students will use the clipboards daily! Students will have the option to &#034;work around the room&#034; with clipboards and will not be tied down to their desks. If we want to work in a circle on the floor during reading centers instead of at the reading table, then using these clipboards will provide us with this option. If we want to work outside under a tree this spring, then we will pack up our work on a clipboard and head outside! \r\n\r\nSidewalk chalk is a great teaching tool! Why use pencil and paper when the weather and our blank sidewalks are calling our names? Otherwise tedious long division and 2 by 2 multiplication becomes a super-fun work of art that students actually enjoy practicing! We can practice geometry, addition, subtraction, and so much much more with sidewalk chalk!\r\n\r\nLastly, using the graph mats we will turn flat paper Venn diagrams and graphs into life-size graphic organizers! These are also waterproof, so they are portable enough to go outside and be used on the ground &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sitting in a chair all day long writing on paper at a desk is just not for everyone. Every once in a while, students simply need to move, and maybe just need a change in scenery. Springtime not only means beautiful, warm weather, but it also means state testing time to us. Being able to use these materials and get out of our seats will really help to ease testing anxiety and provide an alternate way to study!",

They&#039;re from different cultures from around the world. \r\nMy school has a very high rate of free and reduce students. Our teachers are committed to not using that as an excuse to feel sorry for the students when they&#039;re capable of learning and being more than what is expected of them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will use the iPad to as a part of stations for research projects, to use the wonderful apps to explore and discover more details about a certain topic. They will use the iPad to take pictures during P.E. to be use as a guide to assess other student movement techniques like throwing, catching, etc.  Later in the future the students will be allowed to post video and pictures to social media for their parents to check out.  The pad will also be used for students to keep track of their mile times without using paper. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will help instill responsibility in students because they will be in charge of taking pictures, video-recording, and assessing each other. A great thing for students to learn is to hear feedback from their students.  When students are able to watch themselves on video at home for their parents to see, they will want to do better to achieve high standards.  The iPad for the students will allow them to see the many functions it has beyond looking on the web.  An iPad used for P.E sounds awesome.",

We have the most humble, creative and energetic 6th-8th graders, that I don&#039;t want to lose to the gangs because they were bored.  We need options to keep them active, so we volunteer by opening up the school on Saturdays for open gym so our kids can play basketball but during Recess, it&#039;s not an option. During Recess students get 25 minutes before lunch to be active and unwind, however, due to space constraints and lack of man power we can not use the gym or have outside Recess. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Indoor Basketball Arcades and Fitness Dice that I am requesting will help keep our kids active and safe. We would have more options during Recess and allow more kids to participate during our Saturday open gym. We participate in the Healthy Schools program and we hold a Gold medal and our kids are slowly adopting the healthy way of eating. The physical piece they have mastered yet, they have limited areas to release all that energy. I want them to continue feeling safe in their own neighborhood and not have to risk their lives going to the &#034;other side&#034; just to have somewhere to play. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our kids love their school and make sure there isn&#039;t any graffiti, drugs or fights in our school.

      "synopsis": "Knowing and understanding how ones body works is the key to a healthy and happy life. Dance class teaches healthy habits of body and mind. Help my students gain strength and flexibility as they rehab from injury or desire to take their dancing to the next level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of my students have little experience with the world outside of their project, building, and block. They have seen and experienced more than they are even mentally ready to handle. For some, getting to school, let alone graduating is a great achievement. In my New York based high school, finding the right in-road is necessary for a student&#039;s success. The arts provide that in-road for most of these students. They get excited about dance. They enter the dance program unsure of who they are and what they want to become. They end up getting excited about dance and therefore getting excited about coming to school and being successful. They take ownership of their choices and consequences and blossom as young adults. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By funding this project, you will allow our dance studio to have items for injury rehab as well as strength and flexibility training.  These items include stretching charts with colored pictures and descriptions for each of the students to follow according to their bodies needs.  My students will learn how to take care of their bodies after strenuous physical activity by understanding how foam rollers are used in myofascial release of the musculature.  These are the same items that professional athletes use to keep their bodies at optimum performance level.  By introducing the students to this equipment, it shows them how to keep their bodies &#034;dancing for decades&#034;.  Students will learn about resistance band training since this project will provide students with both medium and firm bands. Students that are suffering from or recovering from injury will have a place in the dance studio where they can work on different exercises during class and rehearsal time if you fund this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students will learn how to take care of their bodies and the importance of stretching and massage.  These items will allow the students to self-monitor their own progress as well as provide a space in the room where students can use the equipment before or after class or rehearsal.  Students will become aware of their own personal body needs as it relates to dance activity and general health and well being.",

The health students will create T- Shirts with their own design/slogan. Student will wear their project on a Friday to represent Peace. The students will design their T-shirts using the puffy paint. The other group of students will create buttons representing anti-violence and NO -Bullying. The students will also. advertise their buttons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make a difference by visually showing the students the message of harmony in a diverse school. They will look at their peers  Artwork and expression. The anti-violence, Keep the Peace message will  powerfully be displayed amoung the Health classes walking throughout the school. The project is a PSA announcement that they created and will advertise.",

They love to move and play. They&#039;re full of energy! We spend the day moving about the room engaged in tactile activities to best suit their energetic nature.  \r\nOurs is a Charter School in a high risk area. Many of our students come in far behind grade level and our days are filled with serious lessons, hard work, and catching up. These kids work so hard everyday without much of a break. Our day is longer than a typical school. Students are in session from 8am-3:30pm five days a week. We only get about 20 minutes a day for recess. For that reason I strive to create activities and lessons that get the kids moving and talking with one another. I want them to enjoy school and look forward to coming to see me daily. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials we need are meant for FUN! Our students don&#039;t get much fun during the day. In addition, we DON&#039;T have a playground. Our recess consists of games of tag, running, and rolling on a large paved circle at the back of the school. Due to the serious nature of our school day, the long hours, and the hard work the kids engage in everyday I would love to see them play hard too! All of the play materials would be used for our recess. They can play organized games of soccer, or enjoy playing with hula hoops and foam flyers in small groups. I can already envision them playing with the equipment and it&#039;s a lovely sight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will change our school day completely. The students can look forward to playing games and having good fun to break up the monotony of the school day. The break for fun should help to reset their little brains and get them back on track for more hard work in the afternoon. I can&#039;t wait to play along with them this spring!",

      "synopsis": "Every day my students come in and they are excited and ready to move!  Our typical day is a warm up activity, main lesson that practices basic skills of the unit we are studying or students demonstrate these skills in a game situation.  When class is over we review or discuss the things we learned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m privileged to teach about 350 VERY active elementary students.  For a lot of our children school is the only time for them to learn what it is like to be part of a team and to discover special skills and talents they possess within themselves.  A shocking 85 percent of our students live in low-income neighborhoods and don&#039;t have the money or opportunities to participate in extra curricular activities! Physical Education class gives them a chance to develop and experience new skills, be part of a team, and learn about leading healthy lifestyles.  Every year I try to introduce new activities and equipment to my students to help them expand their learning about the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIn my school district, our budget for physical education resources is incredibly limited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology has been an up and coming learning source for the physical education setting!  One of the things my students love to do during their fitness tests are technology stations such as the DDR, Xavix, and Wii Sports games.  My students also get the opportunity to use a variety of exercise machines such as the elliptical.  During fitness tests it is important to make sure ALL students remain active while not testing.  The HD TV can allow us to project an exercise video on the screen through our laptops and iPads for students to follow in small groups or as one large group. I strongly believe that the implementation of an HD TV would expand their learning and show students that there are many fun and exciting ways to exercise!   Videos can also be good for warm ups or instant activities and cool downs! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve my classroom because it provides another way for kids to exercise in school and also presents the idea that kids can use exercise videos at home as well!  Not every kid likes to go outside and play or shoot a basketball!   \r\n\r\nI also would like to share the HD TV with fellow teachers such as art, music, and computers!  The HD TV can provide ALL specials classes opportunities to expand learning in their classrooms!",

The students had so much fun and all interacted with it in their own way. We will set up various times during the week where the students can earn Kinect time to get the exercise they need as well as learn about personal space, sharing, and cooperation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How could this project not make a difference with my students?

They know that school is important and they work hard everyday to learn something new.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stability Balls will allow my students to get their wiggles out!  We try to move often in class, but we do have to sit and work at tables and desks.  This can be a struggle for a few of my students, but these stability balls will allow my students to move slightly while completing their work.  They will be able to satisfy their desire to be active with the need to complete their assignments.  Using the stability balls will increase their engagement, improve posture, and increase their time on task.  My students will be able to use the stability balls throughout the day for whole group, small group, and independent learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping my first graders active helps keep them engaged and invested in their learning.  Increasing their movement throughout the day is a healthier alternative to sitting still and they will be able to improve their posture instead of slumping in a chair.  My students will be able to focus and take ownership of their learning.",

      "synopsis": "So our students may not be at the playing level of team USA or Brazil, but they sure do love to play soccer, both the boys and the girls. With the weather getting warmer outside, we need to play outdoors. So my request is to get several types of soccer balls for skill development and game play. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our school is located in the heart of a large metropolitan city in Washington state. The setting is a culturally diverse school with students from 20 countries. They speak over 15 different languages. We serve over 220 kids. You can walk down our hallways and hear kids speaking Amharic, Tigrinya, Swahili, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Nepali, Somali, and Oromo, as well as many other languages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of our population has lived in the USA less than 2 years. Many of them have been here for only a few months. Some of our kids have not been in a formal educational setting before, let alone a PE class. They are fortunate, and will get to experience a quality physical education program at our school. \r\n\r\nSoccer is the most popular game around the world. Our non-American born students love to play it. Our kids can relate to one another by discussing, comparing, and bragging about their countries&#039; national soccer teams. We have a comprehensive soccer unit in our PE class. We play indoors as well as outside when the weather is nice. But, we need indoor soccer balls to use when we play inside. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to provide as many traditional American activities for our students as possible. One of the most traditional classes offered through the years has been PE. We&#039;d like our kids to be introduced to such sports as football, soccer, weight training and fitness, volleyball, and baseball. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We know you care about kids and public education. My guess is you are passionate about soccer and physical education. So, please help us, help our students develop the passion for PE and lifetime fitness activities. Your donation will be greatly appreciated. Together we can make this soccer project become a reality.",

The benefits of a nutritious and balanced daily diet will be learned through science experiments and kitchen assignments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our student population is predominantly on free and reduced-price lunch and come from families that are challenged with helping the student with homework (either due to language barriers and/or socio-economic factors). Despite the challenges students come to school with, our junior high school is still filled with a staff that is dedicated to student success. Students come early to our school because they can get free breakfast and feel safe away from their neighborhoods. They often stay and hang around and take the late bus for the very same reasons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be developing their own snack and meal products using our food science kitchens, various kitchen tools and the requested food dehydrators and electric skillets.  The food science class is a STEM driven and project-based learning curriculum that allows students to use kitchen equipment, available ingredients, and teacher guidance to make nutritious foods that students enjoy grazing on throughout their day. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mrs. Michelle Obama has identified youth nutrition and activity as a focus for America for almost a decade now.  At our school, students are hindered socioeconomically as well as culturally when choosing healthy alternatives to high calorie, low nutrient foods.  The class brings forth awareness and empowers students to use ingredients that they have at home to make their own nutrient rich and balanced meals.",

Every single day they are wanting to know more! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are scholars, they are explorers, they are entrepreneurs, they are scientists, they are authors, they are mathematicians, and here at our school every teacher supports them 100% of the time. We set high expectations at our school, and every day those expectations are being met and are being exceeded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning about alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs is a requirement by the state of North Carolina in the new essential standards for Health Education. Mr. Gross Mouth will allow my students to see first hand the harmful and, quite frankly, disgusting effects of using smokeless tobacco, not only on the board and on their own technology, but they will be able to touch it and have that hands-on experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Health is an everyday lesson for the rest of your life. Every single day students will face decisions in regards to their health, and as they grow older peer pressure to participate in potentially harmful events will grow stronger and stronger. Students need to be informed. With Mr. Gross Mouth I hope to extend the knowledge to my students with the hope they will make healthy decisions.",

      "synopsis": "We try to use every moment for learning.  Our school emphasizes the importance of literacy.  My biggest challenge is finding appropriate material for students reading below grade level.  It is embarrassing for fifth graders to be reading books with little girls on the cover! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our school takes pride in the school community.  We celebrate accomplishments and  cheer each other on.  We focus on the positives.  Students are accepting of differences.  The children are kind, cheerful, and helpful. We have a diverse population as well as a poverty status.  In spite of much adversity, our children all want to learn to read! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Internet provides an unlimited number of resources for our students to find &#034;just right reads&#034;.  In order to access these, we need Nexus tablets with protective cases so that even the lowest readers can be engaged at their level.  Hiding a book in your lap so your classmates won&#039;t notice the primary pictures on the cover is a reality for many children.  \r\nThe Nexus tablets will allow many children to read engaging stories, many through our regional public library system.  This would motivate them to use the service and continue to read at home.  Families will benefit by learning about the access also.  Students will have access to any book, any level, any time!  Using the technology is also engaging which motivates some of the most reluctant students.  Some children will also have the opportunity to use headphones with the tablets, allowing them to listen as they read along. Various apps available also allow students to record themselves and work on fluency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The children&#039;s lives will be made better with this project because literacy is essential.  Providing ways to help every child learn to read is crucial for their success in future endeavors.  Students&#039; self-concept is often tied to how they view their success in school.  Using the technology of the tablets to help children learn to read can help them emotionally, socially, and academically.",

This program is called &#034;Classroom in Nature&#034;. They love it! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our students come from a huge NYC school (1850 students) that is one of the most culturally diverse in the country. Most are economically depressed and have problems getting the most basic supplies needed for school. The school gets little funding and has to make do with what is available.\r\n\r\nDespite the inherent problems, the students are eager to explore and become interested in the world once they are introduced to it in unique ways. Through many donations our trips are funded, allowing our inquisitive students to be part of the &#034;Classroom in Nature&#034; series which encompasses all of their major subjects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I use many techniques to guide the students through the woods on these educational trips. The one that garners the most interest is the compass, topographical map, and using my mountaineering skills. They have repeatedly asked to learn the skills to move through the woods and understand the lay of the land better. This would instill within them a sense of pride, understanding, and independence. \r\n\r\nThe materials are a learners kit (pack of 24) of compasses which would be used to teach them the orienteering skills utilizing the hands-on technique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skills and confidence that will be gained translate to many different areas of these students&#039; lives. The new found abilities will help in the Earth Science classes with map skills which are necessary for the Regents Exam. The addition of expertise in this area will lead to a deep sense of self and self-reliance.",

I think I have found a way to incorporate reading into a fitness activity, which will achieve both goals! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are typical American teenagers. They eat too much unhealthy food, they do not exercise enough, they watch too much television, and they are in danger of becoming overweight. We live in a relatively rural area and students do not have easy access to gyms and other exercise venues. Our school offers basic physical education courses, but not any sort of comprehensive fitness program. A recumbent bike would show my students another way to fit exercise into their everyday life, which is one of my goals for them.  Another goal I have for my students is for them to develop a love of reading.  Not just reading to study for a test, or because it is required for a class, but reading for the entertainment, relaxation, and the pleasure it can give. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sounds strange, but what I envision with this project is my students engaging in physical activity WHILE they are reading.  With a recumbent bicycle, the students can comfortably ride while holding a book.  I have a small kiddie swimming pool full of young adult fiction books and magazines in my classroom, and I plan to place the bike beside the pool with a sign that says &#034;Read to Ride.&#034;  Students will be instructed that in order to ride the recumbent bike (and they will want to--new equipment is very appealing), they must read!  Students will earn a double benefit--they will be exercising and reading--both activities that most students don&#039;t experience enough! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donations to this project will help improve students&#039; health and fitness by giving them access to a new piece of exercise equipment. It will improve students&#039; academics by requiring extra reading. Any project that improves health and fitness and encourages reading will always have a spillover effect--healthier, more informed students always equals more productive citizens!",

Our goal is to take back the District Championship Trophy! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ladies on my basketball team are from grades 6-8, and come to me from some of the roughest neighborhoods in the city.  Most are on free and reduced lunch, and most can barely afford the right shoes to play sports. Despite their setbacks, these girls show up on time and ready to learn more. My dedicated team enjoys practice, as it gives them an opportunity to release some stress, while also building friendships with their peers. Their love for the game and each other are inspiring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During practices this year, we have been limited to 3-5 basketballs that the PE department lets us borrow. Unfortunately, sometimes the balls are locked up and we must make due with the one or two that the girls brought from home.  This is no way to prepare a championship team! The 15 basketballs will ensure that every drill, every challenge, every scrimmage can run smoothly with plenty of balls to work with.  (The bag is to keep these balls together while not being used.)  The pinnies will allow me as a coach to run scrimmages without the frustration of my girls not knowing who is on their team.  I have borrowed these as well from the PE department, but they are often torn or there aren&#039;t enough for the girl&#039;s and boy&#039;s teams to use at the same time. The megaphone is simply so I will not lose my voice during practice. I&#039;m useless as a teacher and coach without a voice! I&#039;m hoping by having this equipment, I can streamline practices and ensure my ladies take home a WIN! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing sports has been shown to not only improve students&#039; physical health, but also their self-confidence and interpersonal skills.  By providing my team with the equipment they need to adequately prepare for their games, I hope they will gain more skills and confidence in themselves. Practice makes perfect! So instead of WATCHING, they will finally be DOING!",

Hunger gets in the way of learning and I aim to eliminate that distraction by providing them with daily snacks from caring donor&#039;s like yourself. It is hard to concentrate when your tummy is growling.  We need daily brain food. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our school population consists of 90 percent of the families being on government assisted housing and free or reduced breakfast and lunch programs at school as well as free after school programs that also provide snacks.  We are the school with the highest population of impoverished children in our district.\r\n\r\nI have found over the years that regardless of their economic disparity and many other difficulties, they still come to school with hopes and dreams of being productive members of society one day.  \r\n\r\nYears ago, parents used to be able to contribute to our class snack pantry, but in recent years, those contributions have become a thing of the past.  It has now become a strain on my own finances to have to provide whole class snacks each day for the entire year.\r\n\r\nI prefer to provide the entire class snacks so that everyone has something to eat each day.  Imagine a class where some kids who can afford to bring one eat while others who can&#039;t don&#039;t.  It is inequitable! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With full stomachs, children will be able to fully concentrate on their studies and not that growling tummy they would have had if they didn&#039;t snack.\r\n\r\nDespite us being the school with the highest amount of families with economic challenges, we have also made great strides in achievement through the implementation of a district wide writing program in recent years.  We finally reached our 800 ABI status two years ago and maintained it last year.  We hope this year will continue to show a growth in scores.\r\n\r\nThis would be nearly impossible to achieve if hunger got in the way.\r\n\r\nWe also have great need for Disinfecting Wipes, to keep our desk tops cleaner and germ free.  Each Friday we clean our desks with wet wipes.  Trust me, it isn&#039;t often enough.  These wipes turn black every single week.  If I could afford to buy and use them more often, I would. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduates that come back to visit remember being fed in class and how they were able to contribute to keeping the classroom clean and germ free.\r\n\r\nWith the deadly flu outbreak this year, we need to do all we can to keep desk and table top surfaces clean in order to fight germs.  Feeding the children will contribute toward strong healthy bodies that can also fight those diseases.",

      "synopsis": "We are adding fitness through our longer school day. These fit cards will make meeting this goal easy, and the exercises require no equipment.  Research proves that more than 20 minutes of sitting decreases blood flow to the brain.  Getting up and moving through the day can improve  brain function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our students live in one of the biggest cities in America.  More than 90% come from low-income homes.  We are dedicated to providing them with a safe, high quality school.  Staff work long hours to meet the demands of modern public schools.  We aim to develop  all aspects of children, including their physical fitness.  Because of limited budget and facilities, students have physical education one period a week.  Kids love their physical education classes, but wish they could have more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Fit Deck cards will allow teachers in the classrooms to add physical fitness to each day of the week.  The cards have exercises that use body weight.  The beauty of the cards is that no equipment is required.  Each classroom in grades 1-8 will have their own deck of cards to use every day.  What a relief it will be to have concrete activities that non-physical education teachers can use with ease.  Our goal is to improve fitness, brain function, and add an element of fun to our day.  Everybody wins!  Please help us provide this quality exercise to our students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and teachers will enjoy school more, while engaging in high quality, fun exercise.  In addition to moving more, students can lead these new and exciting activities.  They can even show me in gym class what they have learned.  We want to promote activity now and for a lifetime.  These cards will definitely help us meet the goal of students increasing their activity levels.",

      "synopsis": "According to CDC, children need at least 60 minutes of physical exercise per day. In the winter months, due to cold, wet conditions, it is not easy to get the necessary amount of exercise that is required for this age. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our school is in a high poverty area, close to the Downtown, Southern California region. Due to the metropolitan neighborhood, most of our students live in apartment buildings, without back yards or safe streets and/or cul-de-sacs to play on after school hours. Many parents are working late, so local parks are often not accessible to most of our students. And this is only when the weather cooperates, since winter months are often cold and wet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am requesting jump ropes, bean bags, partner parachutes, and the like, which can be played indoors, requiring small areas to play, keeping the fun alive, while giving much needed exercise to our students. These fun and physically fit equipment will be very well utilized on rainy days, when the students do not have access to outdoor play within the school. \r\nI also plan to use these fun, mildly-competitive games as a part of the reward system, for those who can complete their tasks completely and accurately within time frames within the class. These games will keep the students active and moving within a structured setting. A special thanks to Jamba Juice for making significant efforts to the importance of keeping the children healthy and fit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to CDC Weekly, 2009 July issue, &#034;Childhood obesity continues to be a leading public health concern that disproportionately affects low-income and minority children&#034;, and that continues to affect their health throughout life. It is vital that we start at a young age to teach exercise and staying active and healthy, as they seem to be starting at a disadvantage already by the statistics.",

Our kids spends hours a day watching television and playing video games.

Our goal is to teach every student how to play organized sports by the end of the year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students attend school in an economically disadvantaged community.  We are unable to obtain funding to provide the necessary equipment for our students to be able to participate in organized sports during recess.   We have students who love to play sports, but are unable to because we need more sports equipment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our students are growing up in an age in which video games and television are keeping them from getting much needed exercise.  In addition to our healthy school lunches, we need to now encourage student physical fitness.  Our goal is to teach all students how to play organized games that promote teamwork, sportsmanship, and leadership.  We are also looking to make the most out of our recess time by encouraging kids to get outside, breathe fresh air, and play.  As students learn new games, we can put many of them in charge to lead the games for younger students.  This builds confidence and promotes student leadership.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important things our students will take away from this is sportsmanship and physical fitness.  Our students need to work on sharing equipment, taking turns, and learning different ways to move.  Many of them associate exercise with discomfort or other negative points of view.   As a school we would like to see more students actively involved in recess games and sports to increase confidence and minimize inactivity as a whole.  This leads to a more positive school culture.",

They often do not go outside to play once at home and we have about 15 minutes of recess each day. I would like to encourage movement and physical exercise while learning in our regular day in the classroom. We have to find a way to fight childhood obesity and this starts with making exercise a part of each child&#039;s day and making it a routine activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will use the iPad mini and case daily to increase their movement and exercise in the classroom. They can use many apps that will tell students which movement to do and they can act those movements out. Students will also be able to make videos telling the importance of being healthy and exercising each day. We can then post these videos on our website and share with other classes.\r\n\r\nAlso, The USDA challenged software developers, game designers, students, and others to develop fun and engaging software tools and games that drive children to eat better and be more physically active. Some of the apps I plan to use in my class won awards from the USDA and include Pick Chow, Trainer, Fitter Critters, Smash Your Food, Food Hero, and Food Buster. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your donations will help each of my students learn about health and fitness at an early age and understand the importance of taking care of their bodies and leading a healthy life.

We are a challenging group, that wants to learn and aims to please.  I have 20-30 minutes per lesson in each subject and then work in &#034;brain breaks&#034; for the those who need to move around.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a very diverse group of scholars, from all walks of life.  Each of them has a story to tell, some are great, and others could bring one to tears.  My scholars love to compete, therefore, a lot of competition happens in our classroom.  We usually compete during our &#034;brain breaks&#034; and/or independent activities, and the scholars love for the competitions to be girls vs. boys.  Our school is not much different than our classroom.  The teachers and administrators spend long hours with the scholars making sure they are prepared for the next level in their education.  We work as a professional learning community, knocking ideas off of each other and trying to do what is best for our school and community.  I know that our scholars know we love them and want, with every part of us, for them to be successful in life.  Most of my students receive 504 accommodations for ADHD and I have to find different strategies each day to help them remain on target and feel confident. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars will be able to work mentally while their physical bodies are still able to move.  Many of the scholars that have ADHD in my classroom, are not on medication.  These chairs will assist these scholars who are kinesthetic learners to move while they work.  Usually, I will let some of the scholars move while they work, or walk around the classroom when they have completed a task.  Having these yoga balls will replace regular chairs and they can still move while learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars&#039; lives will change drastically with this addition to our classroom.  It will improve our classroom environment because less time will be spent on redirection and more time on learning.  I do not want my scholars to think there is anything they cannot achieve with hard work and dedication.  Having these chairs, will help them to feel like they can succeed in completing activities without the need to jump around.",

These boys are interested in sports and have never attended a baseball game.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trip the boys will receive will be one they will never forget.  They will use the time at the game to meet players, view Hank Aaron&#039;s childhood home, and take in the understanding of what hard work and dedication can do.  This trip will also provide the boys with a tangible souvenir of what they accomplished.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trip will not only give the boys something they will never do, but it will also build their self-esteem.  These boys will be well-known as the best readers at our school and the ones who earned their trip.",

Throughout the building you can observe the energy. It is not a challenge to get  them into action. Often they cannot get still enough to hear all of the directions. Some of them also love to talk. \r\n\r\nThey love to dance. They love to play with balls. They love to run. Many of them love to tumble and roll.\r\n\r\nThere are over 500 students at our school which includes grades Pre-K through 8th grade. . Half of our students are boys, half are girls.  Roughly 63% of the students are black, 13% white, 13% Hispanic and 10% other. Approximately 40% qualify for a free lunch.\r\n\r\nThe students at our school love to read. We are a high performing school.  Our school is a place where we all work hard, students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lower elementary students will use a tumbling mat and ramp to learn how to roll. We will learn a forward roll and a backward roll with the aid of the ramp. \r\n\r\nStudents in grades 3rd - 5th will be able to use the mat to practice a sequence of rolls. (National PE. standard 1A requires them to perform a movement performance of 5-7 movements. ) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donations for this project will help tremendously. Mats are very expensive. I have never purchased a ramp. This will be very useful in helping younger students be able to perform the forward and the backward roll. In the past I have either passed through these skills quickly or not even taught them because they were so challenging for so many. This will make it so much easier to gets the students to be successful with the skills.",

Our courses address core knowledge requirements for state exams, but also challenge students to develop their writing and critical thinking skills.  Furthermore, our Senior Option program allows eligible high school seniors the opportunity to engage in community service, internship, employment programs, or take undergraduate coursework at partnering colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student will take a Baby home on a rotation basis for the weekend.  They will learn how hard it is to care for an infant as a teenager and the demands an infant will have.  The simulation baby makes it possible for people to practice caring for an infant 24 hours a day, 3 days a week.  Babies cry for care at all hours, day and night. The caregiver determines what the Baby needs: feeding, burping, rocking, diapering. Also, the Baby&#039;s computer tracks it&#039;s care and safe handling, and provides the teacher with a detailed assessment that is downloaded post-simulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The donations will help us expand our health curriculum and give our students a real-life and hands-on experience.  I believe that with this extensive curriculum, the students will have a better understanding about how becoming a teenage parent can impact their future.",

My students deserve to be the best too. They need to have access to the best technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are a Title I school, which means most of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. We are also a culturally diverse school.\r\n\r\nWe strive to help every student to meet their needs. We provide additional materials and health services if needed. We provide backpacks and uniforms to students in need. We instituted academic clubs after school, and pull-out programs to reinforce academics. Because of these additional programs, our students have done well on standardized tests. We have developed a recipe for success. We have a well-rounded specials program where music and art have been brought back and supported after being cut. Having art, music, PE, and computers, helps create the whole child and helps build academics and self-esteem. We are very proud of our students and their achievements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will participate in a creative activity where students work together in a cross-curriculum activity that incorporates high order thinking and have to synthesize new information. My students will combine art, reading, writing, and technology. They will research famous athletes using the computer. They will write and discuss about the athletes with their classmates. They will also illustrate an athlete. Students can draw themselves as a famous athlete or just draw the athlete performing. Students will learn about the Olympics, background information of the athlete, healthy choices, &#034;being active,&#034; and the dedication needed to participate. I want this activity to inspire students to be the best they can from these athletes. I want my students to see that they have the tools to succeed and not let obstacles get in their way. They will achieve this in a creative way through the arts, health, and this cross-curriculum activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I currently have one outdated computer.  I want my students to have access to current technology for all activities in my classroom. They need to have this modality to stay current in today&#039;s society and be ready for today&#039;s workforce. This is a creative activity motivating students to learn about &#034;being active,&#034; and staying healthy. Students will be inspired to make the best choices by making the most in the talents are given. They will be inspired by a creative athlete to achieve this.",

We attempt to satisfy their needs by providing something to eat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My class consists of 9th and a few 10th grade students with behavioral disabilities. Our school consists of students with disabilities. They have problems focusing and cannot sit still.  They travel to our school from different areas. Many students live in foster homes or at a home where one parent is missing. They are wonderful humans who were not treated kindly, therefore they do not trust adults.  We have to fill the gap to make them feel worthwhile and safe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students have to take the Regents exams and they cannot function in class when they are hungry.  As teachers, we feel the need to make sure our students are not hungry and our classroom is a place where our students feel loved. Our students love sports and after gym they need water or a sports drink to quench their thirst.  It is important they are not hungry as this can be a problem for the teacher.  The students will leave the classroom and go from classroom to classroom looking for food. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having snacks in the classroom helps to alleviate disruptive behavior as it helps students to focus on their task. Snacks or food from the cafeteria are the only meals some of our students may have for the day.  Those are the reasons we need donors who can relate to the needs of our students, to donate.

They can barely sit still long enough to take it all in but when I get them comfortable and focused they are like sponges, soaking it all in! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students come from high poverty families. They struggle to get the basic necessities of life many times. We are a Title 1 school with a high percentage of free and reduced lunch. Our school is a place where we like to think outside the box and find different ways to reach all students. They are very eager to learn and share what they have learned with others.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These chairs will help the children be more comfortable when they have to sit for longer periods of time.  It will make sitting longer for test prep easier. They are also great because they are portable. I do a lot of cooperative grouping. This way the students can take their chair and meet with their group at different areas in the classroom.  This will make our book club meeting  easier as they can circle up quickly and comfortably.  It will also make my conference time easier because we can pull up our chairs and meet anywhere in the classroom.  It will also make it easier for my students to get comfortable in a place away from others because they can take their chair and go to a corner and face the wall.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more comfortable you are the more you learn. Who wants to sit on a hard plastic chair all day?! Not me! Many of our chairs are broken and the legs are uneven or the plastic has cracked and can easily pinch students legs. If my students felt comfortable they would be able to focus on the activity at hand and not worry about finding a comfortable spot to sit. The more focused on my lesson I can get them the more they will learn and the better they will do on tests and in life!!!",

Our challenge is that we lack the tools to prepare our delicious veggies once we harvest them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are awesome. They live in a major city, they are almost exclusively part of a minority group, their families usually don&#039;t make very much money, and they are farmers! Our schoolyard garden has taken off. We have hundreds of feet of vegetable beds, we have fruit trees, we have a huge pollinator garden, and we have students who take care of it all. My students no longer shriek when they see a praying mantis; instead they call their friends over to check it out. They no longer think that carrots grow on trees, or that you have to buy everything you eat at the corner store. They love the garden, and they are learning as they grow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we prepare for spring planting, my students identified a big problem: we don&#039;t have the kitchen tools needed to prepare our harvest. While it&#039;s true that my students love to garden, it cannot be denied that the part they enjoy the most is eating what we grow. I am requesting things like measuring cups, mixing bowls, and one really big salad spinner so that my students can better connect to the food we grow in the garden. The materials will mean that my students will be engaged in the garden experience from seed to plate and even tummy. The resources will allow me to expand my teaching to include food preparation for my students who are rarely exposed to fresh food and to get them to try fruits and vegetables that some have never even heard of. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have great students who deserve to know that carrots grow in the ground and that strawberries shouldn&#039;t be the size of apples. Our garden program has exposed students in amazing things, and the resources requested in this proposal will take our program to the next level.

If we don&#039;t begin thinking about education in the early years, our children are at risk of falling behind by the time they start Kindergarten.&#034; - Robert. L. Ehrlich &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;92% of my students receive free or reduced lunch, and over 37% are English language learners! Despite these challenges, we experience joy every day from coming together and working diligently to meet our academic and character development goals. My students believe in themselves and know that I am behind them, cheering them on all the way! Our program is embedded within an elementary school, serving Pre-Kindergarten students, who are at risk of entering school without the skills necessary for success. We have work to do in order to accomplish our goal of having every child ready to succeed in Kindergarten. On rainy days, when we are unable to go outside, my squirmy, sweet, animated students are having trouble paying attention to instruction because they are just bursting with energy- and understandably so! I am requesting indoor gross motor activities that we can use in our classroom. These materials will help my students get their wiggles out so that we can focus and do our work! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to expending energy, my students will be given the benefit of physical activity. Many of my students live in urban areas where they are unable to run and play outside, so if they don&#039;t get physical activity at school- they don&#039;t get it at all! Getting active and taking care of our bodies must be a priority in addition to academic achievement. Materials such as the Let&#039;s Get Moving Activity Mats, Music from Around the World Song Bank and CD, Sing and Move Song Bag and CD,  Swing and Catch Cups, and Parachute will help us accomplish our goals! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is so important that children are getting active each and every day! I want to ensure that my students&#039; bodies and minds are being enriched while they are at school! Indoor activities that help to expend energy will greatly impact my students by allowing them to focus and learn the skills necessary to succeed in Kindergarten and beyond!",

A lot of my students don&#039;t know what Zumba is and how it can help them become physically fit. We have noticed an increase in teenage obesity. It is important to make teens aware how to become physically fit with lifelong activities such as Zumba. Because my students don&#039;t have the money to go to a fitness center where Zumba classes are held, they are unable to experience this valuable fitness activity. My school has been a victim of many budget cuts in our district we are unable the get the things needed to help my students become more active. This project is important because this is will help to decrease some of the health issue some of my students are experiencing due to their increase obesity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projector will help my students will to see what Zumba looks like as well as participate along with what they are seeing. This project will help decrease childhood obesity and increase the fitness level of many students. The projector gives students who are visual learners the ability to see Zumba in action. My students will be able to share what they have learned in class with there family members and this will increase the family members knowledge. Due to the knowledge that others, have therefore changing the culture of there community and decreasing the risk of obesity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project goes beyond my class once students are informed they are able to share what they have learned with their  family therefore helping to decrease obesity. This project is a valuable tool for the class students will gain experience they wouldn&#039;t normally exposed to.",

With these fitness products we will be able to work out and become strong both physically and emotionally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are young females who struggle with self esteem due to poor eating habits and fitness routines. Our school is located in inner city Brooklyn, where they major in performing arts. All females are bright young women whom are unhappy within their skin, and tend to shy away from cameras, and presentations in class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will help them learn a healthier way of life through the importance of daily exercise and a nutritional plan. We will create daily routines with free weights, kettle bell weights, resistance bands, jump ropes, and a weighted bar to build their strength, techniques which they can also utilize at home. This will help them to feel better in health and mind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe this donation will help my students enhance their self esteem which in turn will make them feel more confident within themselves  to not shy away from opportunities to speak or perform in class.",

All have been identified as &#034;at-risk&#034; through a developmental screening. They each have a need in one or more of the following areas: language, cognitive, motor, and social. Some have non-English speaking parents. Many live in low-income homes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community sorting set will help children learn about community helpers such as doctors, nurses, teachers, fire fighters, police, etc. The multicultural food set and grocery store set will help children learn about a variety of healthy foods. Children will learn to express their feelings by working with the Emotions mirrors. They will learn about foods, customs, clothing, and more by reading the 12 books about children around the world and assembling the children around the world puzzle. By working with the multicultural materials, the children will also develop a better understanding of the cultures represented in our school community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your donation will provide materials to help children develop healthy eating habits, awareness of cultures, and vocabulary related to names of foods.

They have various food specific allergies, nutrition and dietary plans which set limitations on things that they can and cannot eat. Learning to prepare basic meals that fit their specific needs will maximize their independence and decrease their reliance. Learning meal preparation will also allow for them to make meals that they love with accommodations as well as healthier alternatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the funded items, students will become familiar with related vocabulary, uses for specific utensils and be able to follow multi-step directions, which will also be useful in other areas of learning. Students will learn how to utilize items within the simulated classroom kitchen which can prepare them for life post secondary school, whether they remain living at home with family, group homes or for future employment opportunities. I have requested items such as a blender which will enable students who can only consume pureed foods, to learn how to make various combinations and develop their own recipes. Students will also learn healthy alternatives to making basic foods using a griddle and hot plate to prepare meats in the appropriate way. A refrigerator for storing perishable materials. The toaster oven will allow students to make healthy pizzas and flat breads. Students will use knives, bowls, forks and spatulas to become familiar with the use of these items. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is essential that students learn healthy and safe methods for preparing their meals. Through hands-on experience, students will develop necessary skills on meal preparation, kitchen safety, following instruction and multi-step directions. Students can learn acquired skills independently and in pursuit of future employment/volunteer opportunities post secondary school. Students learning to cook will boost their confidence, motivation and of course they will have fun!!",
