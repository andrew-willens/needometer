      "synopsis": "My dedicated elementary drama students are facing the challenge of trying to put on major licensed productions such as our last &#034;Little Mermaid, Jr.&#034; but are lacking the much needed resources to help in creating these imaginary worlds, where anything can happen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community my students come from is low income where 95% of them qualify for free or reduced rate lunch. These students do not have the much needed supplies or resources they need to succeed, especially in the fine arts. They have virtually no experience or exposure to any arts at home, whether it be art, theater, or even music. They do have the energy and enthusiasm to explore and create successful programs, but they are lacking the supplies to make it happen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am requesting wireless microphones for my drama students to use for our productions. It will be used for presentations for the entire school, as well as other visiting students and teachers from our district. The microphones will help students enhance their ability to perform by being able to be heard by the audience and not worry about trying to be loud enough to be heard. This all leads to a more creative individual, helping the child solve problems by helping them think through different outcomes to various situations and role playing ways to cope with different, difficult, or new circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is important because the skills taught will help them become successful stage managers, production assistants, writers, and artists. The microphones will be used for all other projects in the future. It will be a true asset for the drama classes. By contributing to this project the impact you make will be endless.",

Their passion for singing is unbridled! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of being a musician is listening to and critiquing musical performances.  We currently do not have a sound system in our choir room, so having an iPod and a portable speaker will allow us to listen to our own recordings from practices and performances as well as recordings by professional singers and choirs.  Just as visual artists study the works of the masters in their chosen field to influence their art, musicians must study the works of master musicians in order to improve their musical skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having equipment to listen to music performances is essential in a choir room.  This equipment will allow me to bring an entire world of performances directly to the students in my classroom.",

Our school is located in a low income neighborhood in Phoenix, Arizona. More than 90% of students are on free or reduced lunch. All of my students (and the majority of students at our school) are English Language Learners. They are also amazing kids who love to learn! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research has shown that music is an effective tool for motivation and productivity. I have asked for a variety of music to use throughout the school day. Specifically, I am requesting two classical music CDs and several grade-level appropriate children&#039;s Disney music CDs. Students will listen to the music while they&#039;re are working independently. I will also use the more upbeat music doing class builders and brain breaks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By donating to this project, you are helping my students to become more motivated and productive. My students love music and it motivates them to get their work done. It is also a great behavior management tool to keep them on task.

Things that any middle school students shouldn&#039;t have to worry about. Though they face great challenges they come to school and achieve great things.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students all come from low income families with 100% of students are on free and reduced lunch and are all bused to our school. Despite our extreme poverty we have some of the highest test scores in the city in both math and language arts. The band is there to help provide support to the students and give them a well rounded education. The success is because these students have a strong desire to further themselves and do great things with their lives.\r\n\r\nEducation is the driving force behind the change in our students, and thereby the change in the community. New technology, methods, and resources will empower these students to stay in school, go to college, and prepare for careers that will provide the necessary socio-economic change that will drive REAL change. We are a part of a revolution in urban education that recognizes and develops talent, creativity, and positive social interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We love having our dropcams in class, and use them all the time. I am able to pull out the parts of class where I am teaching something new, and provide that for the students who are pulled out of my class. It is very helpful to all of those students who are pulled out of my class. This recording service has been on trial, and now we need to buy a year subscription so we can keep on utilizing this tool.  \r\n\r\nIt is so great that I can still provide the best education possible for those kids that are missing my class to work on test taking skills.  Their music education is still very important, and so I want to do everything I can to provide that for them.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is so important because my students mean the world to me! I would love my students to have this experience of band so I can teach them music, theory, and other academic class.",

Help students open their eyes to the world we live in through film. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our school mascot is a dragon.  The spirit of a dragon ultimately represents imagination and creativity. Our students are like our mascot, creative on the inside and fiery on the outside. We are a K-10, public, arts integrated, Title 1 school located in Denver, Colorado.  75% of the students at our school are eligible for free and reduced lunch, and about 40% of the school&#039;s population is English Language Learners.  We have the best attendance in our network within the Denver Public School system, which attests to the fact that the students want to come to school.  Some students ride 3 public transit buses just to make it to a school that offers them an opportunity to be creative and to be their unique selves.  While our students are labeled as both underserved and at risk, they are illustrations of how creativity, the arts, and education can free them from those confines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have requested three HD camcorders for the film club.  Students will be able to increase their visual literacy through the creation of film, by utilizing existing resources at the school in combination with this addition.  The camcorders will also be a valuable resource for other core classes.  Lastly, the camcorders will help support the entire school community when we start creating video announcements/news broadcasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KCAA is an arts integrated school that allows teachers to approach their curriculum and extra curricular activities in unique and creative ways.  The arts make it easier to reach each and every student, especially those students that are less engaged by a traditional educational approach.  KCAA is beginning to delve into the film arts and with the opportunity to utilize sophisticated filmmaking equipment, the film club will only grow.",

      "synopsis": "Students come to music once or twice a week for 30 minutes. By the end of 2nd grade, I want my students to know each instrument of the orchestra. The challenge is to teach them all the instruments of the orchestra in a fun, engaging and exciting way for full student retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students live in a poverished section of the city. They often come from single parent/broken homes. My school is a K-8 school with approximately 2-3 classes per grade level. Students have music once or twice a week for 30 minutes. Even though the students have difficult home lives, they are provided with the best opportunities at school to enrich their lives for the better. The teachers and staff work very hard to give them all that we can so that they leave school everyday with a sense of accomplishment and pride. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will benefit from these DVDs and Book/CD greatly. Those who are visual learners will gain a better wealth of knowledge from watching while learning. Students will be able to earn better grades on quizzes or tests after viewing these videos as an enhancement to their normal learning. The students will also be able to gain knowledge of other cross curricular topics like physics when learning about the sounds of the instruments. They will also be able to accurately place the instruments into their respective families and will gain a better understanding of the orchestra. Students will also explore where and when these instruments were made which will allow them to branch into the historical aspect of music. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donations to this project will help greatly. This product will allow me to use different avenues when writing my lessons and executing them by referring to and showing various clips. The book and CD will aide in explaining the sounds and characteristics with the younger students. Both products will help my students feel better about their music education because they will walk away from class each time with a sense of accomplishment. It may spark an idea in a mind that can ignite a fire.",

Coming from neighborhoods with minimal opportunity, my students use the resources of the Talent/Art Class as a place to safely express themselves.\r\n &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of my students are English Language Learners and Special Needs students. They are struggling financially and come from neighborhoods full of crime and gang activity. They are high school students and they are preparing themselves to enter the world as young adults. Our school is a safe zone, full of caring individuals who treat our student body as family. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, our ability to purchase materials has been cut tremendously. Many of my students would like to pursue higher education or obtain a career in a field relating to the arts. These materials would allow the students to improve their art-making techniques while expanding their portfolios.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having light boxes in the classroom will allow students two practice art making techniques. They will be able to reference major works of art and use the light box to copy those techniques of art making while developing their own personal style. Many of my students love cartooning and the light box will allow them to create characters in a step by step process. Many of my students have desires to apply to major universities and schools. Good materials to create their artwork is crucial for a quality portfolio, in which colleges and jobs will look. Students also have more confidence and self-esteem when they know they are using and trusted with materials that will ensure their success.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These materials will have both an immediate impact as well as a long term impact. The light boxes and markers will allow students this year to be independent, innovative and creative with their art making. These materials will last for years to come, ensuring that the students of future classes will have quality art materials to ensure success in their futures.",

This year when I pulled out the paints they were in terrible condition and we couldn&#039;t do the project I had in mind.  In addition to the projects students look forward to in 3rd grade, there are ideas and art creations that are new inspirations each year.  Those too need paint that we can use.  \r\n\r\nThese projects might be simple shading, blending and mixing projects or they might be detailed realistic representations of objects in our world.  These art projects help students learn to have a critical eye for their own work and the work of others, they help students focus on details and precision and of course they bring beauty and creativity to the students&#039; lives.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These watercolor paints will help my students become more well rounded individuals.

We do not accept excuses and hold high expectations for our students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harrison Community Learning Center is located on the south side of Peoria, Illinois. The neighborhood consists mostly of rental homes and public housing. Almost ninety-eight percent of the students at the school receive free or reduced lunch, an indicator for low-income families. Not only does this percentage of students exceed district standards of low-income students in the school but it also supersedes the percentage of low-income students at the state level. Harrison has a predominantly African American student body; just over seventy-three percent of the student population is African American. Similar to the low-income statistics, this percentage surpasses both the district and state percentages of African American students. Harrison also has a large subgroup of Hispanic students whom are English language learners. Approximately seventeen percent of the student body is Hispanic and almost ten percent of the total school population is limited-English proficient students. &#034;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students need two iPad Mini tablets to make book trailers for book reports after they have read their stories. My Project: We all remember doing book reports in school. You know, read the book and write a page or two telling all about it. For some of us, it took the fun out of reading the book. If we continue to bore students with these types of reports, they will shut-down on reading. That is where the iPad Minis come in. Imagine taking your favorite book and turning it into a movie trailer! Students will use the iPad Minis to create a short movie clip that will entice others to read the book. They will be using 21st Century learning skills to create interactive projects that promote higher level learning. These book trailers will bring the pages of the story to life and help develop and promote students&#039; creativity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sparking an interest in reading, can change a students life forever! Encouraging them to be readers now, will support a life of learning. This project will do not only that, but will also help prepare our students for the 21st century by equipping them with the latest technology.",

There are many wonderful music apps out there that they can benefit from.  They can use them for listening to music from around the world, exploring instruments and instrument sounds, and becoming composers themselves.  Eventually,  I would like to have enough for a classroom set so that all of the students can learn together.   Once I have enough IPADS I also would like to start an after school club where students can learn more about the music profession and composition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your donation will help my students to gain skills in technology that will be essential when they are older.

They live for music class so they can sing, move and play instruments. Excitement always arises for Holiday programs and morning announcements. With them it&#039;s all about the stage!! Being a title one school in a low economic neighborhood students can show pride in themselves and their schools when performing or reviving awards on that stage and being heard over the mic. We are currently using one mic with a cord that not quite long enough for students to be anywhere but the same one spot.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be released from the same one spot for announcements and programs!! They will be free to move about the cafeteria to perform announcements, receive awards, hear speakers and performers, and perform themselves! To see their faces light up when a mic is handed to them is just enough to bring a smile. For children it&#039;s the little things.  My students need to be heard! We need microphones that are wireless so they can move around. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donations to the project will give my students the voice!! The voice to be heard loud and clear!! Not only will they be hear but they can hear and experience performances of their peers or professional performers.",

My students are upbeat, funny, LOVE to dance, and are enthusiastic about music class, and about their education. My school is going through an administrative transition, and I am thankful to have a principal and staff that values the importance of music and the arts in the education of young people. While my principal has provided basic curriculum and percussion instruments, I need to bring technology to my students, because that is how they interact with music and will continue to be the way they interact with music into the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These mp3 players will serve all students in my classrooms by being the foundation of a &#034;listening center.&#034; Using these devices, students will be able to listen to and analyze songs we are discussing in class. They will also be able to listen to and compose instrumental tracks which they can then create lyrics for. Most importantly, through the use of these digital players, they will be able to do this work on an individual basis at a level that is developmentally and artistically appropriate for them. I believe strongly that technology must be a tool that serves a specific function, not simply a frill to entertain students. These mp3 players would play a very specific and crucial role in allowing my students the time to independently learn about music in a way that is very difficult to achieve in a large-group setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This donation would improve my classroom in so many ways. It would allow my students to interact with music on a private, personal level in the classroom. This is crucial, as it allows students to develop their own tastes, preferences, and opinions of music free of judgment from others. Most importantly though, it would allow me to customize lessons and instruction for all different kinds of learners, from my struggling readers and writers, to students who are ready to compose a symphony.",

By using these resources, our students will become one with music and develop new appreciations for this art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green Meadows is a small town school with a high population of low-income families. Many of our students qualify for free or reduced lunches. We also have a high population of ELL (English Language Learner) students that attend our school.  All of our students love music class and are eager to learn new activities.  They love experiencing new things, like learning to play an instrument and composing their own music. At the end of each class, I always have a few students say, &#034;That was fun! Can we do that again next week?&#034;  Our community embraces the students&#039; love for music, too!  Each concert, our gymnasium reaches maximum capacity (500+ people) to see our students perform.  Green Meadows definitely nurtures the love of knowledge for our students! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scarves and activities will benefit my special education classes the most.  They will develop their fine motor and gross motor skills and encourage movement and creativity.  We can also use these scarves for other activities not included in this project.  For instance, we can use them for interpretive dance to different instrumental pieces.  These materials will also be used in the general education classes to give them a few new activities to keep music class fresh and interesting! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By donating to this project, our students will have another creative outlet to use in the classroom.  Many times, music class is the only artistic activity the students have during the day.  These students need more materials to help them learn and grow musically.  As a result, they will become well-rounded creative thinkers!",

The puppets and stand will assist my students with verbal performances and acting out.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Childhood has a limited and insufficient budget.

Very few of my students have home access to computers and the Internet. We have been trying to increase our technology to student ratio to allow more students to have access at once. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students need printer ink for our color printer to make class projects.  My students LOVE to make classroom projects like photo books, holiday gifts for our families, Friday Notes with color photos to keep our families updated, and class yearbooks.\r\n\r\nWe love using tablets as a more developmentally appropriate mode of accessing computerized materials. We received a tablet as a gift from our administrators, but we are unable to use the tablet until we can get our hands on a kid-proof case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teachers lay the foundation, but our computer programs have helped the students to be in charge of their own learning and have really helped them take ownership of their own academic goals. By providing accessories, we will be able to get more students onto our online materials each day and give our classroom projects more pizazz.",

We will also use these materials to integrate the arts into our curriculum, to create authentic learning and engage in hands-on activities. These materials will help us get through the rest of the year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people would probably agree that pencils, erasers, and crayons are necessary materials for any elementary classroom. However, what most people don&#039;t know is that these materials are not always readily available, especially in a Title I school. Many students show up to school with little to no school supplies, leaving it up to the teacher to fund the supplies. Having these basic and vital materials will allow me to really focus on making learning more fun for my students.",

I have taught for 25 years and love it more each year! My students love art and are eager to learn. Due to economic restraints, the art budget has been cut drastically and my students are in great need of these supplies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The math connections are inherent in all of these art lessons. This is the best way to teach both math vocabulary and concepts because it is fun! Kindergarten students will use the printmaking stamps and ink pads to create random, regular and alternating patterns.\r\n\r\nFirst grade students will create quadrilateral robots in collage format using the colored paper and glue, adding details with the crayons. Second grade students will create beautiful concentric circle patterned art using watercolor paint and compasses. Third grade students will create an abstract paintings of multiplication facts with oil pastels and resist tempera wash. Fourth grade students will use compasses to create mandalas; showing radial symmetry, repeating patterns in paint and marker. Fifth grade students will expand geometric shapes into Notan designs, creating collages from the colored bond paper with bilateral symmetry.\r\n\r\nThrough these projects my students will discover the connection between math and art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your support of this project would allow my students to use critical thinking and creativity. The components work together to provide a complete art experience that fosters the connection of math and art!",

One drawing is sown on the stone or the etching plate, and a harvest is reaped from it.&#034;\r\n- Van Gogh &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranging in age from 15 to 18 years old, my Art Club students consistently inspire me with their untapped creative ability as they regularly showcase a diverse set of emerging talents. They make my job a joy because, in addition to their potential, each student brings a wonderful disposition and viewpoint to our sessions. \r\n\r\nOur weekly after-school sessions provide students with invaluable opportunities to enjoy a creative release and a means to look at their respective worlds differently, while exploring artist media and developing important creative problem solving skills.\r\n\r\nLocated on the North side of Milwaukee, we are part of the City&#039;s charter high school program. Our mission is to prepare students in grades 9 through 12 for entry into, and most importantly, success in college. The racial makeup of the school is 99% African-American students; with 96% of the student body being &#034;Free or Reduced Lunch&#034; eligible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent experimentation with color and texture, thanks to the generosity of donors who funded our last project has enabled the development of important foundational skills. Layering color with pastels (using their media creatively), has helped each student refine his/her 3-dimensional thinking as well as gave them opportunities to become accustomed to manipulating media through experimentation (trail and error).    \r\n\r\nTo date, Art Club Students have created one-of-a-kind originals. Collectively and individually, they are excited to delve into more complex art-making processes. Adding printmaking to their repertoire will not only refine their artistic skills, but will also guide them to make connections to the world of publishing. Thus, this project focuses on Multiple Originals. Students will learn terms and techniques by using the requested tools and materials. Extended learning opportunities will include the history of printmaking and its set of traditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most exciting aspect of this project, in my opinion, is: Art Club Students will add a new dimension to their original works of art, transforming their drawings into something more sublime through one or another of the processes of serial reproduction. I am hopeful that this experimentation will give students the confidence to take risks in their general education curriculum / academic classes.",

The majority of our building lives in poverty. Most of the families speak Spanish at home, which makes it difficult for students to understand the English language when it is spoken to them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many language barriers in our building.  The majority of the students speak Spanish as their first language, and the majority of the teachers only speak English.  \r\n\r\nTo help those struggling English language learners better understand academic concepts, I like to bring art into the classroom as often as possible.  Currently, my students receive art 1 time each week for 40 minutes.  I do not believe that is enough time for creativity.  Art is a language that all people speak, no matter what the native tongue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I truly believe art improves academic achievement.  I can use it to help bridge the understanding of difficult concepts, as well as a way to help reinforce concepts taught.  Being able to express yourself through art allows all students, no matter what their language, the ability to learn, self express and form independence.",

      "synopsis": "Knowing and understanding how ones body works is the key to a healthy and happy life. Dance class teaches healthy habits of body and mind. Help my students gain strength and flexibility as they rehab from injury or desire to take their dancing to the next level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of my students have little experience with the world outside of their project, building, and block. They have seen and experienced more than they are even mentally ready to handle. For some, getting to school, let alone graduating is a great achievement. In my New York based high school, finding the right in-road is necessary for a student&#039;s success. The arts provide that in-road for most of these students. They get excited about dance. They enter the dance program unsure of who they are and what they want to become. They end up getting excited about dance and therefore getting excited about coming to school and being successful. They take ownership of their choices and consequences and blossom as young adults. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By funding this project, you will allow our dance studio to have items for injury rehab as well as strength and flexibility training.  These items include stretching charts with colored pictures and descriptions for each of the students to follow according to their bodies needs.  My students will learn how to take care of their bodies after strenuous physical activity by understanding how foam rollers are used in myofascial release of the musculature.  These are the same items that professional athletes use to keep their bodies at optimum performance level.  By introducing the students to this equipment, it shows them how to keep their bodies &#034;dancing for decades&#034;.  Students will learn about resistance band training since this project will provide students with both medium and firm bands. Students that are suffering from or recovering from injury will have a place in the dance studio where they can work on different exercises during class and rehearsal time if you fund this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students will learn how to take care of their bodies and the importance of stretching and massage.  These items will allow the students to self-monitor their own progress as well as provide a space in the room where students can use the equipment before or after class or rehearsal.  Students will become aware of their own personal body needs as it relates to dance activity and general health and well being.",

      "synopsis": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said that &#034;music is the universal language of mankind.&#034; Here at Propel Homestead, we&#039;re linking music and art to find what we like, form our own opinions, learn about our musical and artistic heritage, and create a common language of respect and diversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kiddos in our school have a true passion for learning and creating.  They&#039;re constantly pushing the barriers of musical and artistic ability, performing and creating songs, dances, paintings, sculptures and artistic experiences that inspire everyone to do more.  After changes to our school this past summer, the Creative Arts Department has been relocated into their own space which is utilized by the whole school.  With white walls and little decoration, we need an &#034;extreme school makeover&#034; of our hallway.  Creating an inspiring, beautiful area that prepares and excites students, teachers, and visitors to unleash unimagined potential.  Over the past three years, students have grown physically, mentally, and emotionally in their artistic abilities, and are excited to link their artistic and musical talents together in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will link the information learned in music class about different genres, instruments, performers, and key musical elements with information learned in art classes regarding mural painting techniques and different art styles to create masterful, inspiring artwork for our hallways. Using the canvas panels, paint, and brushes, students will display the different time periods of music and art on each canvas, creating a physical timeline of art, music and general history to display in our Creative Arts Hallway.   The project will serve as a physical reminder of cultural history, and give our students the opportunity to learn new painting techniques, and explore new musical genres and time periods.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six 40 x 40 canvases, once painted, will be permanently installed in our hallway, creating a physical timeline of music, history, and art for our students and staff to travel through as they enter our rooms.  The art will unite our mission to bring high-quality, creative arts education to students everyday, viewing it integral to the development each child, and serving as a point of pride for all students involved in their creation.",

An iPad would offer other options for differentiation.  There are so many fantastic apps on the iPad for students to learn from:  recorder apps that teach them the basics of the instrument and playing the instrument, to pitch recognition apps, to rhythm apps, to piano apps.  There are literally hundreds of ways the students can use the device! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be a great tool for student learning.

They are currently using a sad drumset of broken and mismatched pieces that should have been replaced a decade ago! I believe they deserve to have a great drum set to be proud of and to support the rhythm section in our jazz band! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 800 students in our urban middle school and we have great cultural diversity. Over 85% of our students are eligible for free or reduced cost lunch. Within our school there is a smaller academy consisting of about 146 students all of which must be in the band program! My band students are academically accelerated and highly motivated. Our school band has recently expanded to include 6th grade students, adding 48 students to our roster. In my band, &#034;I want to play the drums&#034; is the most popular request when choosing an instrument for the first time. Being in the percussion section is very popular, we need a drum set to give these students a purpose in learning to read music and a stronger sense of participation in the band and jazz band. Please help us support our growing music program by helping us buy a drum set! Thanks to Donorschoose.org and our many supporters, our music program is growing and thriving! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gretsch Energy 5-Piece Drum Set with Hardware and Sabian SBR Cymbals comes with everything we need - including quality - to allow our students to take their musicianship to another level. It will most definitely be used for many years in all of our ensembles and will benefit a countless number of students with it&#039;s quality and sound. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In three years, our before-school jazz program grew from seven to over thirty five students that are dedicated to learning about and playing jazz. For many students, this program is their first introduction to playing, listening to and enjoying jazz music. I allow any and all students interested to join, no matter what instrument! A broken drum set just doesn&#039;t cut it anymore. We need one that will help us raise the quality of musicianship for everyone involved! Thank you for your support!",

If they have had a bad day (or even a good one) I&#039;ve heard them say that band is the medicine that makes them feel better. It is their favorite time of day! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have some of the best students in the world in my small rural school in Ohio (enrollment is about 650 students K-12). My kids are hard core band heroes! They deserve to have a great experience in band and to play on well maintained instruments. A significant amount of my students receive free or reduced price lunches. Our school just does not have the resources to support our band program. Even though we have a newer building (it is about 13 years old) most of our band equipment is from the middle of the 20th century. Most of our instruments need to be recycled. My students are hard workers and we have fundraisers for everything! We are constantly fundraising for uniforms, instruments, instrument repairs, music, trips, supplies, etc. I want my students to have the very best of everything. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are &#034;The Smallest Band With The Biggest Heart.&#034; This year we proudly marched 39 members (29 instrumentalists and 10 auxiliary). That number is a record for us! We perform at area band shows alongside bands three and four times our size. I tell my students,&#034;You do the same thing the bigger bands do, only on a smaller scale.&#034; The comment I hear over and over again about our band is although we are small, our sound is mighty. We currently have two snare drums. Adding two more snares will not only increase our sound, but it will increase my students confidence. There is confidence in bigger numbers. Two more snares will allow more students the opportunity to be a part of our tiny but awesome drumline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding two new snare drums to our drumline will be tangible evidence to my students that our band is growing. It will also be proof to them that there are people in this world that care about their music education. I believe my students knowing that there are generous and caring people. who put their kind thoughts into actions by investing in our band, will help my students to hold their heads just a little higher when they are performing.",

      "synopsis": "Every day my students come in and they are excited and ready to move!  Our typical day is a warm up activity, main lesson that practices basic skills of the unit we are studying or students demonstrate these skills in a game situation.  When class is over we review or discuss the things we learned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m privileged to teach about 350 VERY active elementary students.  For a lot of our children school is the only time for them to learn what it is like to be part of a team and to discover special skills and talents they possess within themselves.  A shocking 85 percent of our students live in low-income neighborhoods and don&#039;t have the money or opportunities to participate in extra curricular activities! Physical Education class gives them a chance to develop and experience new skills, be part of a team, and learn about leading healthy lifestyles.  Every year I try to introduce new activities and equipment to my students to help them expand their learning about the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIn my school district, our budget for physical education resources is incredibly limited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology has been an up and coming learning source for the physical education setting!  One of the things my students love to do during their fitness tests are technology stations such as the DDR, Xavix, and Wii Sports games.  My students also get the opportunity to use a variety of exercise machines such as the elliptical.  During fitness tests it is important to make sure ALL students remain active while not testing.  The HD TV can allow us to project an exercise video on the screen through our laptops and iPads for students to follow in small groups or as one large group. I strongly believe that the implementation of an HD TV would expand their learning and show students that there are many fun and exciting ways to exercise!   Videos can also be good for warm ups or instant activities and cool downs! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve my classroom because it provides another way for kids to exercise in school and also presents the idea that kids can use exercise videos at home as well!  Not every kid likes to go outside and play or shoot a basketball!   \r\n\r\nI also would like to share the HD TV with fellow teachers such as art, music, and computers!  The HD TV can provide ALL specials classes opportunities to expand learning in their classrooms!",

Making a basket can provide the opportunity for a person to express their view of the world in an artistic way.&#034;\r\n~Iroquoismuseum.org &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students have a zest for understanding new ways of learning.  They are supportive of each other and varying personalities in a classroom environment.  They exemplify group working models evidenced by ownership in products they make.  In the Art room, other subjects are expanded upon by way of project based activities. At the same time, they crave self expression and pursue it  any chance they can get in our school&#039;s art community. As an arts educator it is my privilege to design my curriculum to support those needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My kids will have an opportunity to make various baskets and learn the ways to design them according to African and American cultures. This process involves steps that require group participation. Making baskets provide an encoded framework for ritualized retelling of individual and collective stories. Both the history of the Navajo ancestors and early American history in general can be taught by the sustained investigation of basketry. Making a basket can reflect my student&#039;s identity... feelings are codified in a basket&#039;s physical elements. Materials, designs and even the methods of construction of  baskets convey important messages regarding cultural values and beliefs. They can facilitate my student&#039;s capacity to order and make sense of experience. When one traces a path along a basket&#039;s coils from the center to the outer edge, this action signifies the historical progression of a group of people through time as well as the cyclical nature of the individual life course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make my art room a place of true multicultural, cross curricular learning. A tactile experience working with pliable forms from nature will place my kids in the natural world; understanding indigenous people and the oldest known form of technology. From wide winnowing baskets to weaving and braiding, stunning similarities between African and african American basketry serve as part of this learning process in history and social studies.",

A small number of my students also live in foster care or are homeless. These extenuating circumstances provide the students with limited exposure to the arts. Through my music class, I strive to teach basic music making skills as well as provide them with a foundation in artistic cultural literacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ear buds and on-board smart phone speakers are the way the general public experiences most of its music. We usually choose not to watch our favorite movies on our phones, if only for the small screen and tiny speakers doing an injustice to the thematic experience. So why then do we accept this media format for all of our musical needs? How can we teach children about the importance of music when they have never experienced the power of sound? As a music teacher, I feel it is not only my job to teach music as a subject, but to facilitate music as an &#034;experience.&#034; Through these superior BOSE sound systems, my students will encounter rich and warm sound during music class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allowing my students to hear music at its best, I believe they will become life-long listeners and come to value high fidelity as an indispensable element to &#034;experiencing&#034; music .",

      "synopsis": "With technology, the art curriculum can be more engaging with projects.   Incorporating iPads in the art room will help bring new ways to participate with projects and presentation, especially for accommodating students with multiple learning styles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are a lively bunch! I teach at two schools, and I love to see them every week. Our school district is over 70% low income with a diverse community. Many students transfer in during the year from different schools, states, or even countries with little to no experience with art. We teach respect and responsibility in our district, and the students demonstrate their pride in their school in all classes, including my art rooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology I am requesting would help students in many ways.  First, I can adapt lessons for multiple learning styles.  Many students are sensitive to materials, and require additional assistance with producing the art product.  The iPad has apps that could help accommodate those students.  The iPad can also assist in documenting student work.  With apps available, students can upload images of their work and create &#034;artist statements,&#034; which incorporates writing skills.  \r\n\r\nThe iPad also has additional apps that art teachers can use to show elements of art within the classroom.  With the use of projection (projector adapter) and stylus, I can demonstrate how projects can be created without students leaving their seats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is important to my students because they love to see how technology inspire ideas for art. Having at least one iPad in the art room will help to enhance their creative thinking and give chances to explore ideas with the use of technology.",

      "synopsis": "With STEM and Common Core State Standards we are incorporating more opportunities to use technology across the curriculum. I am trying to give my students the opportunity to &#034;show&#034; what they learn through making videos. Recently we received a green screen for videos, but he sound quality is missing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are striving for ways to participate in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) activities. Our CA school is a magnet school of math, science, and technology ; the first, newly adopted magnet school program in the district.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a brief description of my 4th grade classroom and school. Our school is in a high-poverty, low social economic area with 91% of our school receiving free or reduced breakfast and/or lunch. The demographics are: 86% Hispanic, 7% African-American, 6% Caucasian, 1% Other. At our school, 57% of our students are English language learners. Only 22% of our parents have taken a college or vocational class and about 4% have a college degree.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help my 4th graders &#034;show what they know&#034; by using a higher quality microphone, iPad adapter, and iPad tripod mount, along with the Green Screen video technology that was recently donated. By adding the audio andsound recording to this videos, it will improve the quality level of the videos. My Magnet School Program (Math, Science, and Technology) is trying to incorporate more technology into the curriculum all the time. If they were able to create videos to describe the process of something they are learning, how much more powerful would that be?\r\n\r\nThe videos could be shared by the entire school, grade level, and/or on the Internet for anyone to use. Video creation allows students to use their higher level thinking skills; like critical thinking and problem solving. We have the cameras, but would like to take our videos to the next level with green screen technology and audio equipment.\r\n &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I envision my students working in teams and collaborating to spread their knowledge by creating these videos. Their creative minds need to be expanded and the green screen and audio equipment can let their imaginations run wild! As you can see, the audio equipment, tripod mount, and adapter will help my students &#034;show what they know&#034; by creating videos of what they are learning in all subjects. Can&#039;t you just see these kids teaching each other what they learned and having fun creating videos?",

      "synopsis": "The Arts, dance, music, theater and visual arts are basic and core subject areas, and are essential to the well-rounded education of the whole child.&#034; - Randy Dorn. Integrating video and still photography into our arts curriculum will further enhance our program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are an amazing group of highly creative and intelligent second graders. They love to be challenged and are enthusiastic about learning every day. They also love to express themselves artistically. Our school is a small community of diverse learners from a variety of cultural backgrounds. There are many different languages spoken at our school such as Arabic, Tagalog, Korean, Spanish, Armenian, and Portuguese. Our school is also home to a large population of Deaf and Hard of Hearing students. We are defined as a socioeconomically disadvantaged school but our students are all bright, eager, creative, critical thinkers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A digital camera will have many different functions in our classroom. We will be able to take photos of our classwork, field trips, and other activities we participate in and upload them to our Shutterfly account for parents and friends to see. We will also be able to use the video feature to record our theater performances and show them to visitors at Open House. Allowing students to actually view their performance will make theater even more exciting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photographs and video make lasting memories for children and their parents. It provides something tangible for them to take home and share. It may spark a passion in some of my students to want to continue in performing and visual arts or even become the next Steven Spielberg! Every bit of technology that is brought into my classroom will make students&#039; experience that much better.",

I&#039;m trying to turn my classroom into a partial art room, starting with basics such as color construction paper.  Learning through doing, is the best way to teach students at such a young age.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I teach four special needs three-year-olds, and they have the most inspiring little faces you&#039;ll ever see. These student come from all over the county since they are special needs. One of the many benefits of teaching in Florida, is that our students are extremely diverse. They all come in with different types of life experiences. But as soon as they walk through the classroom door, they all need the same opportunities to develop artistic and math skills. \r\n &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m requesting various art supplies from Lakeshore such as paint, construction paper, feathers, colored pasta and 3-D foam shapes. I was shocked by the amount of academic work my three-year-olds were expected to comprehend. Art is one of very few remaining subjects that my students can still fully enjoy with no boundaries. I am requesting various art materials to help my student express themselves and make connections with the different math concepts. With the new art materials, I will be able to make learning more fun. At this age, students should be learning through play.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students are going to use the materials to make concrete connections to the concepts being taught. My students are very sensory-based and struggle with abstract thought. Being able to hold and manipulate material that relate to the concept, will help them understand what is being said.",

      "synopsis": "New England winters can get very cold and snowy resulting in a lot of &#034;indoor recess.&#034;  We need books that combine movement and literacy so that we can READ and MOVE indoors during the winter months! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 80% of our students come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Many of these children don&#039;t have access to the selection of reading materials that children from more affluent families take for granted. Our children have a great hunger for knowledge, but often lack the materials to fulfill this appetite.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are requesting a collection of books that are read aloud AND allow for movement.  For example...  the book &#034;From Head to Toe,&#034; by Eric Carle, is a book that has pictures of beloved animals doing movements with parts of their bodies.  When children are invited to join in with moving the corresponding parts of their bodies, the book suddenly comes alive!  Read aloud time becomes an opportunity to move in a fun way!  Each of the books on the list was specially selected for its way of allowing teachers to introduce movement into read aloud time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demographics should not equal destiny. Although my students may come from disadvantaged backgrounds and don&#039;t always have access to the latest resources, they have a desire to reach for the stars. Having a book collection like this could make a real difference.",

Visual aides help students to retain all of this new knowledge and we need the supplies to help us create anchor charts and review materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are a very low income kindergarten through fifth grade school in a small town. Our classes are large and our resources are limited. We are classified as a very low-income school and we try to be as resourceful and creative as we can. We have the basic supplies, but we need help acquiring the special extras that really help students excel. Our classes have been expanding this year as we absorb students from a school that closed. This is increasing our need for supplies more than ever. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I introduce a new topic, I like to have my students help me organize the information into graphic organizers that can help them make more sense of the Common Core Standards we are studying. I would love to have supplies like the requested repositionable poster paper, bright markers of different sizes, and standards cards with student friendly &#034;I can...&#034; statements available to help gain more interest and illustrate what we&#039;re learning. We can leave the chart paper on the requested easel or post it somewhere around the room for easy review while working on the practice sheets from the Common Core review books.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My kids love to draw and create visual aides to remember all their new information, but we just don&#039;t have the necessary supplies at this time.  This project will provide the supplies to help us create anchor charts with bright and attention grabbing colors, display the anchor charts easily, and enable us to have our Common Core standards posted in a handy tabletop pocket chart for quick review.  I would love to have a way to keep our materials posted like this all the time for my students to reference whenever needed.",

Our students love to learn and devour anything related to music, art, and dance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books&#039; main purpose would to be supplemental resources for the 5th grade Harlem Renaissance unit. They study the artists, photographers, dancers, and musicians of the time period. Students can also use these books for pleasure reading if they choose to check them out. They will use these books to obtain knowledge about the time period where Harlem experienced a rebirth of African American talent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These books will allow students to gain a better understanding of the Harlem Renaissance. With the addition of Common Core State Standards, supplemental texts are needed besides the text book. Students will be exposed to the artists, musicians, photographers, and dancers of the era.",

It is a friendly competition to get students to think outside of the box when they are working on projects. They choose their partners or decide to work by themselves. We have had some amazing projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our school is in coastal south Georgia, located right beside a large military base. Due to the large military population that our school serves, we have a very diverse population of multicultural students. These military students also tend to be very transient which can be hard on them adjusting, as well as catching up. Many students come from a very high poverty home situation, and this puts a strain on many of the families in trying to support our school financially. However, they still support us fully in ensuring every student is college or career ready. Our school serves over 1800 students with a high percentage on free and reduced price lunch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you were competing, would you want yours to look like everyone else&#039;s. No way! So my students are always asking if I have other stencils. So I would love to give them more to choose from!   We also need replacement bulbs for our heat lamps that we use in several of our labs. The graduated cylinders have been in major need since we have so many science teachers, there usually are not enough to go around and we are always waiting for someone else to finish a lab before we can use them. So often times, labs go undone due to the limited amounted of supplies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you please help our students get the graduated cylinder sets that we need to be able to do multiple labs? We also need heat lamp bulbs to replace our blown ones. Our students are wanting to win our version of our art and science wars by allowing their personalities to shine in our competition. Can you help our students bring their personalities and knowledge out in the best ways possible? Help be a part of our art and science wars!",

Trying to transfer wire connection to and from the iPad to the computer is extremely time consuming and plagued with technical difficulties at every use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have 25 of the smartest, most creative five year olds in the world.  They are all eager to learn and always ready for the next learning adventure.  Our school is located just east of Los Angeles in a predominantly Latino community.   More than half of our student population qualifies for free or reduced price lunch.   Most parents are hardworking people trying their best to provide all their children need to succeed in school.   Volunteer hours and support at home is what many families can and do give. Unfortunately, monetary support to the school in not possible for the majority.  Our community also has the largest population of foster children in Los Angeles school county.  Many grandparents on fixed incomes are taking the responsibility of raising their grandchildren.  With more and more cuts to our school budget, we teachers struggle to provide the basic needs of our students.   Please help me do just that. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music and movement are avenues to learning in any kindergarten class. Little ones love and need both.   Whether it be an audio book, a sing along or a step by step dance program, kindergarten learning is enhanced by the sounds of language in any form.  A speaker system that works would be invaluable.  \r\n\r\nThe wireless feature will allow us to be mobile.   We will no longer be limited by wires or plugs.   The bluetooth feature will allow music and movement to follow wherever the lesson and learning may lead us. Even outdoors! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music and movement provide countless opportunities for kindergarten learning.  From letters and sounds to mastering science concepts, music can make the most complex concepts accessible.  Songs and dance make the learning fun.   With a wireless speaker my students can experience this first hand.   Please donate to fund our project today.",

      "synopsis": "My students  travel vicariously to Texas, Mexico, San Juan, Ecuador and Spain through the pages of a textbook. To enliven the journey, I want to give the girls in my classes an opportunity to see tango performed live- in person and up close! It&#039;s a cultural experience they will remember forever. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My high school is a college preparatory, all girls high school located in a large urban city. Many of my students have not traveled anywhere beyond the borders of their neighborhoods. Whether the reason is safety, or lack of interest, I want my girls to learn to appreciate the art and drama of other cultures. It is extremely important for them to have a cultural appreciation for groups of people who do not talk like them, eat the same foods, or even speak the same language. Dance is the unifying thread for my students.\r\n\r\nTango is the dance expression of a country that has blossomed world wide. There is history, politics, language, race, and censorship connected to this dance that was once performed by men only. While my students enjoy dance, I believe this would be a totally unique and new experience for them. Women can be leaders as well as followers in tango. This alone makes it a unique approach for raising self esteem and encouraging the girls to go out into the world prepared. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My students are freshman and sophomores in a college preparatory high school in Philadelphia. They are always attentive when there is dance and movement. In our unit on Spain and Lorca, they were mesmerized by flamenco. I hope to convey that appreciation for tango as they watch a live performance. \r\n\r\nTango is a dance that combines European and African cultures. The music itself is a combination of various types of music from Europe. During the Depression in the 1930&#039;s and again in the 1950&#039;s in Argentina, dictators banned public gathering and so, tango was prohibited. Today it is considered an &#034;intangible cultural heritage&#034; by UNESCO. \r\n\r\nI think this is an interesting lesson for students to be aware of- that a public gathering of people historically has been banned in some countries. Imagine that this dance once provoked  fear and censorship. Tango was an art form that was provocative, popular and feared by dictators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is very important that the students are exposed to cultures that are unique from their own. Our city is a city of neighborhoods. Often, my students do not have an opportunity to experience the sounds, music, or art of other cultures. Language can be a barrier. \r\n\r\nLearning about tango and watching a performance would be a step in opening the minds and hearts of young students. We are a fast paced world of Internet and texting- the personal connection is often left out. This would correct that.",

The wireless speaker I am requesting will allow me to bring more music into the classroom.  Currently, if I want to play music for my students, I have to burn the playlist onto a CD.  With a wireless speaker, I can play music directly from my Mac or iPad.  I will not have bother with connecting chords and wires.  I will also be able to show my students videos and connect the sounds to the wireless speaker so that all students can hear clearly.  The iPad stand will also make the music more accessible.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having the wireless speaker will help make our classroom more updated in technology.  Students will enjoy listening to their favorite tunes and poems anywhere in school.  The iPad stand will also make using the iPad easier for students to use during their center time.",

We have six preschool classrooms, which serve all types of children with various types of abilities and learning needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each classroom would receive 2 Cd&#039;s, to be enjoyed by 190 students that we currently serve and many future students as well.\r\nMusic will help our students with the following: Early Literacy- Following a rhythm helps develop pre-reading skills, Listening- Listening to different tempos and melodies encourages auditory development, Math- Repeating patterns, sequencing, Movement- Helps develop motor coordination, Transitions- Can make moving from one activity to the next easy and fun for children, Self Esteem- There is no right or wrong in music and it nurtures self-confidence, and much, much more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I chose music in my students&#039; native language as well as well as their second language because they will be great resources in helping to develop their literacy skills, among many others, in both languages.

They come to school every day so excited to explore and learn!  They use the materials in the classroom to discover their own talents and to further their own knowledge in all subjects.  They enjoy discovering new words as they read the big books, creating numbers using our base ten materials and explaining science concepts using concrete objects.  Many of my students come from low income homes where learning materials are not available and most of the students in my class are English Language Learners.  The students participate in all learning activities without complaint because of their desire to learn, even when the tasks are difficult for them.  \r\n\r\nMy students work very hard but their favorite time of the day is Free Choice Exploration Centers where they are allowed to choose a center to explore: dramatic play, painting, art, computers, blocks and building, puzzles, tactile play (water, play dough, etc) and puppets.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you were in our classroom in the afternoon, you would see children excited about learning while they worked in exploration centers.  Students choose from a variety of centers including dramatic play, art, science, and PUPPETS.   I would like to be able to &#034;showcase&#034; the puppets for the themes we are learning about in the classroom on a puppet stand so the puppets are easily accessible for the children. We have a puppet stage and I have collected numerous puppets that they can choose from.  These puppets are located in boxes and bags that require the students to dig in and find the puppets they want to use, in which they often only choose what is on top of the pile and don&#039;t explore all that is available. It seems that digging through the bins inhibits their full, creative use of the puppet center.  If we had a puppet stand I could display the puppets, therefore making the puppet center more attractive for students to create their own stories and plays.  Drama is so important! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By donating a puppet stand to our classroom, students will choose to explore the dramatic play/puppet center more often.  Having the puppets displayed for them will make it more likely they will participate in creating dramas and plays using puppets of animals and people that we are learning about in science, social studies and literature.  Using familiar materials will further their learning.  Dramatic play is an important aspect of learning for young students and a wonderful creative outlet!",
